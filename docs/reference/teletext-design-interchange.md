# Teletext design interchange

## Delivery state

Planned contract; not an operational import/export interface. Level 2.5 authored
support, durable designs/drafts, editor roundtrips and real-client acceptance are
open. Existing Western Latin Level 1/1.5 candidates are preparatory. No new CLI,
admin route, metadata schema implementation or editor binary is claimed here.

## Standards audit

Basis: [ETSI EN 300 706 V1.2.1 (2003-04)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/300700_300799/300706/01.02.01_60/en_300706v010201p.pdf).
Clause references below identify encoding/decoding requirements, not delivered
capability. Optional use in an individual page does not limit the engine target.

| Feature | Relevant clauses | Required implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Base/fallback | 10.1, 12.1–2, annexes A–D | Correct base rows, G0/national/G1, spacing and update/order semantics. |
| Level 1.5 | 12.3.4, annex E.3 | G2/diacritics and applicable G3 fallback. |
| Extended repertoires | 12.3.4, 15 | G0/G2 designation: Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic and Hebrew. |
| Non-spacing attributes | 12.3 | Colour, flash, size, boxing, conceal, inversion, underline and row/screen attributes. |
| Palettes | 9.4.2, 9.5.1, 12.4 | 32 colours; fixed CLUT0/1, editable CLUT2/3, remapping/substitution and page/magazine precedence. |
| Objects | 9.6.2, 10.5–6, 13 | Local/public/global, active/adaptive/passive, links and MOT precedence. |
| DRCS | 14.1, 14.4.1 | 12×10×1 glyphs; two 48-glyph subtables, at most 24 selected per display page. |
| Side panels | 12.5 | Object-based 16-column side-panel extension and fallback. |
| Level 3.5 rejection | 12.1, 14.4.2 | Targeted rejection of multicolour DRCS, font styles and CLUT0/1 redefinition. |

Annex E is informative; its encoding guidance limit is not a normative service
limit. Charset, resource, fallback and client coverage must have explicit test
cases. A report that FFmpeg contains libzvbi does not prove this matrix.

## Pinned QTeletextMaker source audit

Audit target: [QTeletextMaker 1.0](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/releases/tag/1.0),
commit `cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898`. This is source inspection,
not a downloaded-artifact check or actual editor roundtrip.

The [loader](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/blob/cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898/src/qteletextmaker/loadformats.cpp)
interprets DE/PN/PS/RE/CT/FL/OL. SC handling is disabled. It uses the first page
number, treats later PN records as ordinal subpages and ignores their addresses.
Custom records and PF/DS/SP are not retained. Blank lines stop loading; short
rows/packets can be padded. M/29 is imported as X/28.

The [writer](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/blob/cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898/src/qteletextmaker/saveformats.cpp)
uses CRLF and assigns ordinal subcodes: zero for one subpage, 1…N for several.
FLOF X/27/0 becomes page-only FL links, losing exact-subpage targeting. Unknown
records disappear. These behaviors require host identity/navigation reconciliation.

[Document conversion](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/blob/cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898/src/qteletextmaker/document.cpp)
rebuilds enhancement fields; semantic equivalence does not imply byte-preserving
packet export. Palette/side-panel/local-object editing exists, but
[documented limitations](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/blob/cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898/README.md)
include skipped POP/GPOP invocations. The
[DRCS workflow](https://github.com/gkthemac/QTeletextMaker/blob/cac2167bac933a6160cca45a45d5d4ee95355898/examples/Level2p5-DRCS/README-drcs.md)
loads dependencies separately and does not provide bitmap editing. Resource-page
classification and unsupported editor transformations must be checked explicitly.
QTeletextMaker alone cannot establish the full enhanced broadcast-client gate.

## Planned project bundle

Export selection includes a page, selected subpages or a supported complete set.
The bundle contains `ersatzrs-teletext-project.json`, editable TTI documents and
required object/DRCS assets. One editable TTI file maps to one stable page/subpage;
the editor may write subcode zero while the manifest retains the exact identity.
Do not embed the only copy of metadata in custom TTI commands.

Sidecar `schema_version = 1` and `editor_profile = "qteletextmaker-1.0"` must declare:

- Model/interchange/editor profile versions and a host-verifiable export receipt.
- Exact page/subcode-to-file mapping, entry/language/region and navigation.
- Resource kinds, dependencies and semantic baseline hashes.
- Addon/template/package identity and version, profile revision and selected theme.
- Supported overrides, named zone boundaries, dynamic field bindings and generated
  regions, with distinct free/zone/generated edit permissions.

All uploaded metadata is untrusted. Validate paths, file/count/byte/resource bounds,
identities, schema versions and dependencies before allocation or publication.
Compare authority/revisions with the host, not the sidecar's own declarations.
Missing sidecar data cannot confer addon-template edit permission. Ambiguous new/
reordered subpages or changed exact links need explicit resolution, never guessed
matching. Resource editing that the pinned editor cannot preserve must be refused
or use a separately validated structured resource file; never claim a lossy export.

## Planned validation and evidence sequence

The same application functions serve admin and structured agent workflows:

1. Select design/profile and exact export scope; save TTI plus sidecar/dependencies.
2. Verify and record the actual editor artifact/version; visibly open/edit/save
   editable files in QTeletextMaker, retaining the sidecar and protected assets.
3. Import into a separate draft; report normalization, unsupported features,
   identity/dependency conflicts and edits outside free/declared-zone boundaries.
4. Validate the complete typed model and native encoding, with page/subcode/position
   and relative file/line diagnostics. Preview enhanced and base views from it.
5. Persist the draft separately. Publish only by explicit action with fresh
   configuration, package and generation checks. Import cannot alter transmission.
6. Capture the actual published output. Run TSDuck, independent decoding and real
   display/subpage/navigation in a demonstrably suitable client.

Agent inputs/outputs must be bounded files and structured diagnostics using the
same model and edit permissions. Provide documented validation/export/import/
preview entry points when implemented; do not invent currently runnable commands.
Template/package edits use the explicit addon version workflow. Dynamic guide
content remains generated, and profiles/Lua retain their existing scope/timing.

Record host/package/model/editor/client/decoder versions, artifact hashes, feature
fixtures, results and limitations. Localized headed Chromium/Firefox, hydrated/
no-JS and light/dark evidence is required for changed admin. A valid file, a draft,
a browser preview, a transport check and a published client result are separate
claims. Kodi is optional; TSDuck alone does not prove Level 2.5 display.
