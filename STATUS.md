### What an Agent Should Do Next

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are complete. Phase 2 now has a working FFmpeg foundation:
typed inputs, command generation, complex filter routing, software/NVENC/VAAPI
pipeline builders, watermark/subtitle/song-progress filters, drawvg SVG
template rendering, ffconcat v1.0 playlist writing, snapshot tests, and a
development MPEG-TS streaming route at `/dev/stream/bbb.ts` using local Big
Buck Bunny fixtures when present. Phase 3 now has a `ersatzrs-core` scheduling
foundation with a shared `PlayoutSchedulingEngine` trait, deterministic
in-memory scheduling adapters behind content resolver traits, block scheduling,
sequential YAML instruction dispatch, Lua 5.4 scripted scheduling, playout
anchors, gaps, pre-roll/post-roll/mid-roll, watermark and graphics state, filler
kinds, YAML content source resolution for collection, multi_collection,
smart_collection, playlist, search, and single media item references, practical
history application/cleanup, exact chronological history resume by media item
details, structured playlist child/current-child history behavior for the
in-memory adapter, a core-owned Lucene-like search query parser/evaluator, and
SQLite search-document projection for represented metadata fields with
show/season/artist container expansion.

What remains before Phase 3 can be considered end-to-end complete:

1. Continue search-index parity beyond the current SQL-backed parser/evaluator:
   add a real index/analyzer when needed, cover language/subtitle/codec/dimensions
   and other Lucene fields, add director/writer joins when the schema represents
   them, and broaden provider-specific metadata edge cases.
2. Continue block scheduling parity beyond the current SQL-backed reference-data
   slice: broaden change-detection removal/update handling beyond the current
   block/template/playout-template key comparison plus collection-etag checks,
   persist remaining block-item/deco flags such as guide inclusion and disabled
   watermarks, and add any still-missing scheduling fields that matter once more
   real playout/editor flows are wired.
3. Complete YAML parity for remaining exact handler semantics (SQL-backed
   playlist item resolution, expression evaluation, imports, shuffle-groups,
   and batch/count playlist child enumeration now have focused coverage).
4. ~~Expand Lua scheduling bindings~~ — done: `add_count`, `add_all`,
   `add_duration` (trim/fallback/discard_attempts/stop_before_end/offline_tail),
   `pad_to_next`, `pad_until`, `skip`, `skip_to`, `rewind`, `pre_roll_on/off`,
   `lock/unlock_guide_group`, `is_done`, `watermark_on/off` (by name),
   `graphics_on/off_path` (by path), `add_collection`, `add_multi_collection`,
   `add_smart_collection`, `add_search`, `add_show`, `add_playlist`, `add_key`,
   `add_marathon` (group-by show/season/artist/album/director with round-robin
   cycling, shuffle_groups, play_all, item_order, and history resume),
   `create_playlist` (inline playlist assembly from existing enumerators with
   history resume). Reset-mode history removal, history resume on collection
   registration. 22 snapshot tests, all passing. Full ErsatzTV Lua API parity
   achieved.
5. Compare generated timelines against ErsatzTV fixtures where available and
   add longer integration tests with local Big Buck Bunny media.
6. Continue Phase 2 protocol work by replacing `/dev/stream/bbb.ts` with real
   channel playout/IPTV streaming once scheduled playout selection is wired.

Persistence parity gaps are now tracked per table in
`docs/reference/persistence-gap-matrix.md`. The highest-risk next persistence
slice remains the `P1` group there, with playout runtime-state writes now
covered; next priority is media polymorphic rows, media versions/files,
streams/chapters/subtitles/language codes, metadata joins, program schedule
item subtypes, template items, block item targets, and deco break/template
rows.

### Known TODOs from Phase 0

- Docker dependency layer caching (copy manifests first, build deps, then copy src) — improves CI build times.
- Replace bash `/dev/tcp` HEALTHCHECK with a purpose-built `ersatzrs-healthcheck` binary.
- `axum = "0.7"` pinned to match `leptos_axum 0.7` — bump both when leptos_axum upgrades to axum 0.8.
- `std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")` in `main.rs` uses `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` — replace with a config crate in Phase 1.
- `ffmpeg` module in `ersatzrs-web` migrated to `ersatzrs-ffmpeg` in Phase 2.

### Blocking Decisions

None. All Phase 0 decisions are recorded in ADRs 0001–0007.
