## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — Domain and Persistence** (in progress)

### Phase 0 Checklist

- [x] Documentation contracts (CONTRIBUTING, STYLE, ARCHITECTURE, PORTING)
- [x] ADRs 0001–0007
- [x] Diataxis documentation structure
- [x] Parity matrix skeleton
- [x] GitHub CI, issue templates, PR template, dependabot
- [x] Tooling config (rustfmt, clippy, deny, editorconfig, gitattributes)
- [x] Claude skills for recurring workflows
- [x] Conventional Commits and commitlint
- [x] Cargo workspace and empty crate stubs
- [x] FFmpeg 8.1 runtime detection and fail-fast
- [x] Minimal axum + Leptos SSR page
- [x] SQLite bootstrap (empty DB on first run)
- [x] Docker image with FFmpeg 8.1
- [x] Health endpoint (`/healthz` → 200)

### What an Agent Should Do Next

Phase 0 is complete. **Phase 1 — Domain and Persistence** is in progress:

1. Read [plans/sequential-dancing-valiant.md](plans/sequential-dancing-valiant.md) Phase 1.
2. Read [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) and study `/home/bart/ErsatzTV/ErsatzTV.Core/Domain/`.
3. Continue refining the `nastv-domain` port as schema details are mapped.
4. Build out the remaining repository surface that still exposes only aggregate
   IDs where Phase 2 and Phase 3 need richer child-row persistence.
5. Start Phase 2/3 implementation work against the expanded normalized schema:
   FFmpeg pipeline persistence dependencies, playout anchors, and scheduling
   child-item repositories.

### Known TODOs from Phase 0

- Docker dependency layer caching (copy manifests first, build deps, then copy src) — improves CI build times.
- Replace bash `/dev/tcp` HEALTHCHECK with a purpose-built `nastv-healthcheck` binary.
- `axum = "0.7"` pinned to match `leptos_axum 0.7` — bump both when leptos_axum upgrades to axum 0.8.
- `std::env::var("DATABASE_URL")` in `main.rs` uses `#[allow(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` — replace with a config crate in Phase 1.
- `ffmpeg` module in `nastv-web` — `FfmpegVersion` and `parse_version` should migrate to `nastv-ffmpeg` in Phase 2.

### Blocking Decisions

None. All Phase 0 decisions are recorded in ADRs 0001–0007.

## Session Log

| Date | Agent | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-04-15 | Copilot (Claude) | Audited repo readiness; added CODEX.md, STATUS.md, copilot-instructions.md, Commands section in AGENTS.md. |
| 2026-04-15 | Claude Code (claude-sonnet-4-6) | Completed Phase 0: Cargo workspace, FFmpeg 8.1 detection, axum+Leptos SSR, SQLite bootstrap, /healthz, Dockerfile. Branch: phase/0-bootstrap. |
| 2026-04-15 | Codex | Started Phase 1 by porting channel, playout, schedule, media, collection, playlist, block, library, media-source, FFmpeg profile, watermark, graphics, artwork, and filler domain entities into `nastv-domain`. |
| 2026-04-15 | Codex | Added Phase 1 persistence foundation: repository traits, SQLite migration, sqlx repositories, offline metadata, tests, and cargo-deny cleanup. |
| 2026-04-15 | GitHub Copilot (GPT-5.4) | Replaced the hybrid JSON/scalar persistence layer with an expanded normalized SQLite schema, normalized repository mappings, and updated integration tests/sqlx metadata. |
